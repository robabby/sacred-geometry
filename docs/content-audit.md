## Priority Issues

### High Priority (Missing Key Sections)

| File | Missing Sections | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| 64-tetrahedron.mdx | Meditation, Construction, Historical | Shortest overall content (7 sections) |
| flower-of-life.mdx | Meditation | Only 5 sections - short for central pattern |
| golden-ratio.mdx | Meditation | Only 6 sections |

### Medium Priority (Partial Gaps)

| File | Issue |
|------|-------|
| tree-of-life.mdx | Missing Construction section (how to draw it) |
| torus.mdx | Missing Construction/Visualization section |
| pentagram.mdx | Missing Construction section |
| vesica-piscis.mdx | Construction embedded but not explicit section |

### Missing Internal Links (Common Issue)

Almost all files mention related geometries but lack hyperlinks:

**Platonic Solids:**
- tetrahedron.mdx → cube, octahedron (not linked)
- hexahedron.mdx → octahedron (not linked)
- octahedron.mdx → cube, tetrahedron, icosahedron (not linked)
- dodecahedron.mdx → icosahedron, cube (not linked)
- icosahedron.mdx → dodecahedron (not linked)

**Sacred Patterns:**
- seed-of-life.mdx → Egg of Life, Flower of Life, Fruit of Life
- egg-of-life.mdx → Seed of Life, Flower of Life
- germ-of-life.mdx → Seed of Life, Flower of Life
- fruit-of-life.mdx → Metatron's Cube
- tree-of-life.mdx → Flower of Life
- vector-equilibrium.mdx → Flower of Life
- pentagram.mdx → golden-ratio
- philosophers-stone.mdx → vesica-piscis, Metatron's Cube

## Platonic Solids Detailed Findings

| File | Sections | Missing Required | Passive Voice | Filler Words |
|------|----------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| tetrahedron.mdx | 8 | None | 3 | 0 |
| hexahedron.mdx | 9 | None | 4 | 0 |
| octahedron.mdx | 10 | None | 5 | 0 |
| dodecahedron.mdx | 10 | None | 6 | 0 |
| icosahedron.mdx | 9 | None | 4 | 0 |

**Notes:** All Platonic Solids have complete section coverage. Naming varies (e.g., "Meditation: The Cube of Space" vs. "Meditation & Energy Work") but content is present.

## Writing Quality Findings

### Filler Words Found (4 total)

1. **vesica-piscis.mdx:** "just" - "This wasn't just aesthetic"
2. **golden-ratio.mdx:** "quite literally"
3. **pentagram.mdx:** "quite literally" (line 9)
4. **pentagram.mdx:** "mere coincidence" (acceptable in context)

### Passive Voice Assessment

Passive voice instances range from 2-6 per file. Most are acceptable definitional statements:
- "The octahedron is the geometric dual of the cube"
- "The Sri Yantra is composed of nine interlocking triangles"

These read naturally and don't need revision.

## Best-Structured Files (Models for Others)

1. **circle-dot.mdx** - Comprehensive coverage, clear progression
2. **sri-yantra.mdx** - Very thorough, all categories covered
3. **vector-equilibrium.mdx** - Good scientific rigor with spiritual balance
4. **star-tetrahedron.mdx** - Comprehensive with good skeptical balance
5. **metatrons-cube.mdx** - Excellent internal links to Platonic Solids

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Missing Sections (High Priority)
1. [ ] 64-tetrahedron.mdx - Add Meditation, Construction, Historical sections
2. [ ] flower-of-life.mdx - Add Meditation section
3. [ ] golden-ratio.mdx - Add Meditation section

### Phase 2: Add Missing Sections (Medium Priority)
4. [ ] tree-of-life.mdx - Add Construction section
5. [ ] torus.mdx - Add Construction section
6. [ ] pentagram.mdx - Add Construction section
7. [ ] vesica-piscis.mdx - Make Construction explicit section

### Phase 3: Add Internal Links (All Files)
8. [ ] Platonic Solids - Add cross-links between all 5
9. [ ] Sacred Patterns - Add cross-links to related patterns

### Phase 4: Fix Writing Quality
10. [ ] Remove "quite literally" from golden-ratio.mdx and pentagram.mdx
11. [ ] Consider revising "just" in vesica-piscis.mdx
