# Sacred Geometry Content Audit Plan

> **Linear Issue:** [SG-123](https://linear.app/sherpagg/issue/SG-123/content-audit-and-quality-improvement)
> **Branch:** `sg-123-content-audit-and-quality-improvement`

## Session Resumption

After `/clear` or `/compact`, run:
```
Read docs/plans/content-audit-plan.md and Linear issue SG-123 to resume content audit work. Check the progress tracking section for current status.
```

## Overview

Comprehensive content audit covering structure, writing quality, and depth for all 22 MDX files. Approach: **Audit First, Then Fix** with **Category-Specific Templates + Flexible Minimums**.

## Content Inventory

**Platonic Solids (5 files):** tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron
**Sacred Patterns (17 files):** circle-dot, vesica-piscis, seed-of-life, egg-of-life, germ-of-life, flower-of-life, fruit-of-life, metatrons-cube, tree-of-life, sri-yantra, golden-ratio, torus, vector-equilibrium, star-tetrahedron, 64-tetrahedron, pentagram, philosophers-stone

## Section Templates

### Platonic Solids Template (6 Required + 2 Optional)

**Required Sections:**
1. **Symbolic Properties** - Element associations, chakra, key symbolism
2. **Mathematical Insights** - Faces/vertices/edges, formulas, unique properties
3. **Dual Relationships** - Connection to dual solid, what this symbolizes
4. **In Chemistry/Nature** - Molecular geometry, crystal structures, natural occurrences
5. **Ancient Wisdom** - Historical/cultural appearances, sacred architecture
6. **Meditation & Energy Work** - Practical spiritual applications

**Optional Sections (pick 1-2):**
- Unique Property Deep Dive (e.g., Self-Dual for tetrahedron)
- Related Forms (e.g., Star Tetrahedron/Merkaba)
- Scientific Applications (beyond chemistry)
- Construction/Drawing

### Sacred Patterns Template (5 Required + 2-4 Optional)

**Required Sections:**
1. **Symbolic Properties** - Core meaning, associations, spiritual significance
2. **Mathematical/Geometric Insights** - Numbers, ratios, construction principles
3. **Construction** - Step-by-step how the pattern is formed
4. **Historical & Cultural** - Where it appears across traditions
5. **Meditation & Energy Work** - Practical applications

**Optional Sections (pick 2-4 based on pattern):**
- Contained Geometries (e.g., Metatron's Cube contains all Platonics)
- Relationship to Other Patterns (derivation chain)
- Scientific Connections (physics, biology, cosmology)
- Deeper Symbolism (numerology, archetypes)
- Spiritual Lineage (specific traditions: Kabbalah, Egyptian, etc.)

## Writing Quality Criteria (Elements of Style)

### Apply These Principles

1. **Use active voice** - "The tetrahedron represents fire" not "Fire is represented by the tetrahedron"
2. **Put statements in positive form** - Say what IS, not what ISN'T
3. **Use definite, specific, concrete language** - Avoid vague abstractions
4. **Omit needless words** - Cut "very," "really," "basically," "actually"
5. **Keep related words together** - Subject near verb, modifier near modified
6. **Place emphatic words at end** - Build to the important point

### Specific Checks

- [ ] No passive voice without good reason
- [ ] No filler words (very, really, basically, actually, quite, somewhat)
- [ ] No vague phrases ("in some ways," "of sorts," "kind of")
- [ ] Bold terms used consistently for key concepts
- [ ] Bullet lists parallel in structure
- [ ] Links to related geometries where appropriate

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 22 files have required sections for their category
- [ ] All files pass writing quality checks
- [ ] Consistent section count per category (6-8 for Platonics, 7-9 for Patterns)
- [ ] No passive voice without justification
- [ ] No filler words remaining
- [ ] Audit report documents all changes made

### Current Session Notes
_Update this section each session with what was accomplished and what's next._

**Session 1:** Setup complete - created Linear issue SG-123, checked out branch, created persistent plan file. Ran full audit of all 22 files. Created docs/content-audit.md with detailed findings.

**Key Findings:**
- Platonic Solids: All have required sections, need internal links
- Sacred Patterns: 7 files missing sections (3 high priority, 4 medium)
- Writing quality is strong - only 4 filler words found total
- Passive voice minimal and acceptable

**Next Steps:**
1. HIGH: Add sections to 64-tetrahedron.mdx (most gaps)
2. HIGH: Add Meditation to flower-of-life.mdx and golden-ratio.mdx
3. MEDIUM: Add Construction to tree-of-life, torus, pentagram, vesica-piscis
4. Add internal links to all Platonic Solids
5. Add internal links to Sacred Patterns
