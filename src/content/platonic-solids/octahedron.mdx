## Symbolic Properties

Shaped like two square pyramids joined at their bases, the octahedron represents **integration and balance**. One pyramid points to the heavens, the other to the earth—perfectly unified at the center. In sacred geometry, it symbolizes:

**Key Associations:**

- **Air and breath**, the messenger between realms
- **The Heart Chakra**, where upper and lower energies meet
- **Communication and exchange** of ideas and energy
- **As above, so below**—the hermetic principle

## Mathematical Insights

The octahedron is the **geometric dual** of the cube. If you place a point at the center of each face of a cube and connect them, you create an octahedron. This duality represents the profound relationship between Earth (cube) and Air (octahedron)—the material and the intellectual, form and thought.
