## The Seven Days of Creation

The Seed of Life consists of seven circles: one central circle surrounded by six others in perfect hexagonal symmetry. This pattern mirrors the creation story found in many traditions—seven days, seven stages, seven levels.

The first circle represents the void or unity. The second creates the vesica piscis. By the seventh circle, the complete Seed pattern emerges—the blueprint from which all of creation unfolds.

## Foundation of the Flower

The Seed of Life is the inner component of the Flower of Life. If you continue the pattern outward, adding more circles following the same geometric rules, the Seed blossoms into the full Flower. It represents potential—the seed from which infinite complexity grows.
