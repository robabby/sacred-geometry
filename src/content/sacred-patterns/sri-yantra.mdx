## The Sacred Geometry

The Sri Yantra (also Shri Yantra) is composed of nine interlocking triangles radiating from a central point (bindu):

**Five Downward Triangles:** Represent Shakti, the divine feminine principle—creation, manifestation, and material reality.

**Four Upward Triangles:** Represent Shiva, the divine masculine principle—consciousness, transcendence, and pure awareness.

These nine triangles intersect to form 43 smaller triangles, organized in five concentric levels. The entire pattern is enclosed by two lotus rings (8 petals and 16 petals) and a square enclosure with four T-shaped portals.

## The Journey Inward

The Sri Yantra is often used in meditation, representing the spiritual journey from outer material reality to inner enlightenment:

1. **Outer Square:** The material world, earthly existence
2. **Lotus Rings:** Layers of consciousness, chakras, stages of awareness
3. **Triangular Layers:** Progressive levels of reality, from gross to subtle
4. **Central Bindu:** The point of absolute unity, the source of all creation

## Divine Union

The Sri Yantra represents the union of opposites—masculine and feminine, spirit and matter, consciousness and energy. This union creates the universe. The central bindu is the point of creation where these polarities merge into one, representing enlightenment, wholeness, and the return to source.

## Mathematical Precision

Creating a perfect Sri Yantra is considered extremely difficult—the nine triangles must intersect at precise angles to create the proper pattern. Many believe this geometric precision channels specific energies, making it a powerful tool for meditation, manifestation, and spiritual practice.
