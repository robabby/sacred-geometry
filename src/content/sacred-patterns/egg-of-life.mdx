## The Geometry of Life

The Egg of Life consists of eight spheres arranged in a pattern that mirrors the first eight cells of embryonic development. This sacred geometry reveals the mathematical blueprint underlying all multicellular life forms.

Created by rotating the Seed of Life pattern, the Egg of Life represents the transition from the seven-fold symmetry of creation to the infinite complexity of the Flower of Life. Its oval shape echoes the form of an actual egg—the vessel from which all life emerges.

## Embryonic Development

The Egg of Life perfectly mirrors the first stages of cellular division after conception. From a single cell, life divides into two, then four, then eight—precisely the pattern shown in this geometry.

This eight-cell stage, known as the morula in biology, represents a critical moment in development. Every human, every animal, every plant begins with this same geometric pattern—a universal template encoded in the fabric of creation itself.

## The Bridge Between Patterns

The Egg of Life serves as a transitional form between the Seed of Life and the Flower of Life. It demonstrates how simple geometric principles—the rotation and overlapping of circles—generate increasingly complex patterns that underlie all of existence.

## Symbolic Meaning

- **Cell Division:** Represents the eight-cell stage of embryonic development (the morula)
- **Blueprint of Life:** Shows the geometric pattern underlying all multicellular organisms
- **Transformation:** The bridge between potential (Seed) and manifestation (Flower)
- **Organic Forms:** The oval shape reflects the egg as the vessel of life
- **Eight-fold Path:** In spiritual traditions, the number eight represents renewal and new beginnings
