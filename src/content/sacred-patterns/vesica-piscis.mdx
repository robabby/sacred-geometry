## The Portal of Creation

The Vesica Piscis is formed when two circles of equal size overlap such that the center of each circle touches the circumference of the other. This simple geometric operation creates the almond-shaped "vesica" in the center—a shape that has profound symbolic and mathematical significance.

It is called the "womb of geometry" because all other geometric forms can be derived from it. The vesica generates the triangle, square, pentagon, and all platonic solids through continued geometric construction.

## Foundation of Sacred Geometry

The Vesica Piscis is the fundamental building block of the Seed of Life and Flower of Life patterns. When you create the Seed of Life by drawing seven circles, you're actually creating six vesica piscis formations radiating from the center.

The mathematical ratio of the width to height of the vesica piscis is 1:√3 (approximately 1:1.732), connecting it to the geometry of equilateral triangles and hexagons.
