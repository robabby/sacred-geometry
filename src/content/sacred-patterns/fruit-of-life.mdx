## From Seed to Fruit

The Fruit of Life consists of 13 circles arranged in a specific pattern derived from the Flower of Life. If the Seed of Life represents the initial stages of creation (the first seven "days"), and the Flower of Life represents the full blossoming of creation's potential, then the Fruit of Life is the essence extracted—the concentrated blueprint of the universe itself.

These thirteen circles are not randomly selected. They form a precise geometric grid that, when connected with straight lines, creates Metatron's Cube—one of the most sacred and powerful symbols in sacred geometry, containing all five Platonic Solids.

## The Blueprint of Creation

When you connect the centers of the 13 circles with straight lines, the result is Metatron's Cube. This transformation reveals how the Fruit of Life serves as a bridge between circular (feminine) and linear (masculine) geometries—between curved potential and angular manifestation.

The 13 circles can be seen as representing the 13 archangels in some traditions, or the 13 lunar cycles in a solar year, connecting this pattern to both celestial mechanics and spiritual hierarchies.
