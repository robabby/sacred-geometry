### Key Architecture Patterns

**Data Model**: Centralized geometry catalog in `src/lib/data/geometries.ts` with type-safe helper functions for querying relationships.

**3D Components**: Reusable `GeometryViewer` component in `src/components/3d/` provides a consistent framework for all 3D visualizations.

**Dynamic Routing**: Use slug-based routing with `getGeometryBySlug()` for flexible, data-driven pages.

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive architecture documentation.

## Data Model

The app uses a centralized data model for all sacred geometries and their relationships. Key features:

- 16 geometries with full metadata (id, name, slug, category, description, relationships)
- Type-safe TypeScript interfaces
- Helper functions for querying relationships, filtering by category/element, and searching

Example usage:

```typescript
import { getGeometryBySlug, getRelatedGeometries } from "@/lib/data";

const geometry = getGeometryBySlug("flower-of-life");
const { dual, contains, appearsIn } = getRelatedGeometries(geometry.id);
```

See `src/lib/data/README.md` for complete documentation.
